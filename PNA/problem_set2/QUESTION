0) am I doing any of these right? Or should they be .pml scripts without .cmd?

1) how do you exactly determine which residues are abcdefg

2) how to make set_view work? I think it works now in 5a

3) how to make a pretty view with the proper clipping?

4) water molecule in middle of other waters in 5c. Coordinating h-bonds?

5) am I showing too many residues in 5a? What is the focus?
